========
From the LM339, MC3004, and an OP-AMP, we will get the phase from the LM339. We will get 2-4 voltage values. 

We will get the distance: Two of the voltages squared and then use the distance formula. 
The formula to calculate the distance is: sqrt((V_x)^2+(V_y)^2)=k/d^3
We will get the angle: arctan(V_x/V_y)
We want to isolate the voltages from the rest of the code, we just want distance and angle.
